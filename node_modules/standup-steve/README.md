## Is Standup Steve for you? ##

`Standup Steve` is not one of these "Bot as a service" deals. To get Steve on board, you have to get your hands dirty. 

If terms like "server hosting" or "API tokens" is Greek to you, let me recommend one of the available [commercial options](https://tjaart.slack.com/apps/search?q=standup).

Otherwise, if you choose the red pill, [read the docs](http://steve.tjaart.org/docs/)
